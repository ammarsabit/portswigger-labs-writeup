# PortSwigger Web Security Academy - Solved Labs

This file tracks my progress through [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security) labs. I focus on web app pentesting, documenting key labs as full writeups (linked below) and logging all solves here for reference. Full writeups are reserved for first-time techniques, complex exploits, or custom tools.
